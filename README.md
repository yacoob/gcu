[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/39fb5576-3cb9-4a94-b61c-4e9eb0fd9108/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gcu/deploys)

# GCU has following dependencies

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [lightgallery](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery.js)

Plus some [Python libraries](Pipfile).

## TODO

* switch the live site to Netlify
* get rid of the bootstrap, maybe a new layout
* better caching headers
* rewrite the generator in rust (maybe change YAML to TOML too)
